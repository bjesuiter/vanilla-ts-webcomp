# Vanilla TS Webcomp 

## Running locally 

1. Clone Repo 
2. `npm i`
4. `npm start` (starts typescript compile in watch mode and a webserver serving the whole repo)

## Positives for this solution 

1. It compiles the webcomponent with original tsc => supports decorators!
2. Imports can be made from a cdn/any webserver, but type information is available for local coding assistance.

## Negatives
